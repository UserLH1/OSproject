# C Testing Framework

## Overview

This C Testing Framework is designed to compile and run C source code from a given folder structure, check the execution correctness, and compare output against predefined test cases. It simplifies the process of unit testing for C projects and ensures that changes to the code do not break functionality.

## Features

- Automatic identification of `.c` source files for compilation.
- Compilation of C code with support for custom flags.
- Execution of compiled binaries with output capture.
- Comparison of program output against expected results.
- Generation of detailed test reports.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) or another C compiler must be installed on your system.
- `make` or other build automation tools compatible with your system.

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
